# The randint function is imported from the random library so that
# you are able to generate integers at random.

# Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randint

# For example, consider the function call expression: randint(1, 100)
# It will evaluate to an int value >= 1 and <= 100.
